Synopsis

This repository has the code to create an HTML web form (agent.txt) that will schedule an electric IMP device to turn on a light plugged into pin9.  

Note, I bought all the hardware for this product including the April Development Board (IMP), Breadboard, and jumper wires/LED and put it together from scratch. 

Motivation

I wanted to play around with building an IOT device from scratch.
